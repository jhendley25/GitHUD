# GitHUD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhendley25/GitHUD.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhendley25/GitHUD)

## About

**GitHUD** is  an open-source project for viewing github repository and user statistics in a meaningful way.  

## Contributions

Like any open-source project, everyone is welcome to send PRs and open issues.  It is my hope that this will take on a life of its own.
 

## Current status

Made it to 0.0.1.  Some interesting bugs on page load, but working for the most part.

###SUPER!!
